## What is it??
This application simulates some of the algorithms that the CPU uses to schedlue the execution of processes. This application is still in beta, some features like the dark-light mode and the SRTF algorithm don't work!

It's really simple to use this program.

## Bugs

_- The graph can be buggy when resizing the window._

_- The "Clear" button doesn't remove the context/mode swtich._

_- There is no "external saving" file, the plan was to use the settings.xml to save a file with the settings in %appdata%._
